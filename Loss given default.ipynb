    "default, you first need to have a well framed definition of default. For non-retail exposures rating agencies such as Moody's, Standard $\\&$ Poor's and Fitch use definitions of default which although to a large extent overlapping are not identically the same. Hence if you use different definitions of default then of course you cannot compare the resulting default and loss rates. More specifically there is a direct correlation between the default definition, the default rates and the loss or LGD values. Hence, when you see LGD rates reported it is always\n",
    "important to ask for the default definition adopted to make sure you can correctly interpret and benchmark them.\n",
    "Usually a bank will distinguish between different types of defaults: an operational default is due to technical\n",
    "issues at the obligor site, for example an obligor is accidentally late when making the payment, a technical default is a default due to an internal information system issue, for example the payment was made on time but on the wrong account, a real default is a default due to financial problems or insolvency. These are the defaults we are interested in when modeling LGD. In case of default various actions can take place. First there can be a cure. This means a defaulter will pay back all outstanding debt and return to performing or thus non defaulter status\n",
    "with no accompanying loss. There could also be a restructuring or settlement whereby the bank and the defaulter work out a recovery or repayment plan. This could for example result into an extension of the loan maturity to reduce the monthly installment amount. This usually comes with a medium loss. Finally, there could also be liquidation, repossession or foreclosure which implies that the bank takes full possession of the collateral asset if available and sells it by starting up a bankruptcy procedure. Depending upon the value of the collateral this may come with a high loss. When modeling LGD, it is of key importance that the default definition used is the same as for PD. Remember PD and LGD will be combined to calculate both expected and unexpected loss. Hence, it is important that both definitions are consistent. Note that changing the default definition simultaneously impacts both the PD and LGD. If you would for example relax the default definition from 90 days to 60 days in payment\n",
    "arrears then the default rates and PD will increase but the loss rates and LGD will decrease. Hence, the combined effect in terms of expected loss stays relatively constant. Cures are those defaulters that become non defaulters or back performing by repaying all outstanding debt. The corresponding LGD will thus be zero or close to zero (it happens in case of full recovery $LGD = 1 - RR$ whicg RR stands for the recovery rate ) as already mentioned. Note that this depends upon the default definition. Relaxing the definition of a default for example from 90 days to 60 days will typically\n",
    "increase the number of cures. Cn case of multiple defaults you could opt to only include the last default event and also relate the PD and EAD to this. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> The loss given default can now be defined as the ratio of the loss on an exposure due to the default of an obligor to the amount outstanding at default. As such it is the complement of the recovery rate or, in other words LGD equals 1 minus the recovery rate. Important to note here is that LGD focusses on economic loss, rather than accounting loss. Hence, all costs, but potentially also benefits, need to be properly taken into account when defining the LGD. Example costs are: the costs for realizing the collateral value, administrative costs incurred for example by sending collection letters or making telephone calls with the\n",
    "defaulted obligor, legal costs, time delays in what is recovered, etc. Also extra benefits such as interests on arrears, penalties for delays or other commissions can however be considered.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> The most popular method for defining LGD is the workout method which is frequently adopted for both corporate and retail exposures. The idea here is to work out the collection process of a defaulted exposure and carefully inspect the incoming and outgoing cash flows. Both direct and indirect cash flows should be considered. Example indirect costs could be the operating costs of the workout department. These cash flows should then be discounted to the moment of default to calculate the loss. Here you can see a simplified example. Let's assume an exposure goes into default with an exposure at default or EAD of $\\$100$. Soon after the default the collection department will contact the defaulted obligor either by telephone or by sending a collection letter. Let's assume the cost for this equals $\\$5$. This is followed by the obligor paying back $\\$20$\n",
    "which is clearly not enough to cover all outstanding debt so the collection department contacts the obligor again ata cost of $\\$5$. Let's say that the obligor does not react so the bank decides to materialize the collateral and receives $\\$70$ for it. We can now discount all these cash flows back to the moment of default using a discount factor which we leave unspecified for the moment. Let's say that the discounted amount equals $\\$70$. Note that this is smaller than the sum of the four numbers which equals $\\$80$ because of the discounting that has been\n",
    "applied. In other words this means that $\\$70$ has been recovered from the $\\$100$ EAD hereby giving a recovery rate of $70\\%$ and an LGD of $30\\%$. Another way to measure the LGD is by using the market approach. The idea here is to look at firms that went bankrupt and have debt securities such as bonds or loans trading in the market. Once the bankruptcy event has occurred the bonds will become junk bonds and investors will start trading them based upon what they think they will recover from the bankrupt firm. To allow for some time for the market to stabilize and absorb all information this approach looks at the market price one month after the bankruptcy or default event. This market price is then used as a proxy for the recovery rate which will then also allow to calculate\n",
    "the LGD as one minus the recovery rate. Note that this approach only works for debt securities that trade in the market and thus not for retail exposures. This was the approach which was followed by Moody's in their LossCalc tool. The implied historical LGD method works by using the PD estimates and the observed losses to derive the implied LGD. In other words it calculates the expected loss first and then makes use of the expression expected loss equals PD times LGD. The LGD can then be backed out as the expected loss divided by the PD. Note however that according to the EU regulation this approach is only allowed for the retail exposure class. Finally, the implied market LGD approach is a very theoretical approach and I've never seen it being used in the industry. It analyzes the market price of risky but not defaulted bonds using asset pricing models such as structural or reduced form\n",
    "models. It then finds the spread above the risk-free rate which reflects the expected loss and backs out the LGD from there. One of the key concerns of this approach is that the market price is only partially determined by the credit risk. This approach is not often used because it is rather difficult. It is also not encouraged by the EBA.\n",

    "itself has to say about it. Well according to Basel, the definition of loss used in estimating LGD is economic loss. As already said, this means that every cash flow or cost related to the default should be properly taken\n",

The workout period can finish when the non recovered value is less than $5\\%$ of the EAD, one year after default, at the time of repossession of the collateral, or at the time of selling of the debt to a collection agency. On average many financial institutions have workout periods of two to three years. A combination method can also be adopted. </p>\n",

The general idea is that banks need to incorporate results of incomplete workouts into LGD estimates unless they are not relevant. The EBA says: institutions should ensure that the relevant information from incomplete\n",
    "recovery processes is taken into account in a conservative manner. However none of the regulations provides concrete guidance as to how incomplete workouts should be treated. Incomplete workouts can be treated in various ways. A first treatment option is to calculate the current LGD of an incomplete workout and use this as the\n",
    "final LGD value in the data set. This is a very conservative approach giving an upward bias to the LGDs. In other words using this approach, the LGDs will be overestimated since additional future recoveries are likely. Note however that I have seen some banks systematically disregard recoveries after 3 or 5 years into their LGD calculations. Another option is by using expert or predictive models which estimate the final LGD of an incomplete workout based upon various characteristics such as date of default, percentage already collected, time of collection, etc. The most easy method is simply to ignore incomplete workouts and only include complete workouts in the LGD modelling data set. This approach is quite commonly used in practice. Finally, you can also\n",
    "use survival analysis whereby the last amount is considered as a censored variable at for example 12 months. Note however, that this is very theoretical and not commonly applied in industry.

    "discounting. A key problem when applying discounting is setting the discount rate. Also here within the context of LGD modeling, this is not that easy. Various choices are available. Let's briefly discuss some of them. A first option is the contract rate at time of default. Another option is to use the risk-free rate with a risk premium added. Also the weighted average cost of capital or WACC is sometimes considered. The contract rate is quite commonly used although it has been criticized. The EBA regulation says institutions should discount all recoveries, costs and additional drawings after the moment of default using an annual discounting rate\n",
    "composed of the primary interbank for example Euribor offered rate applicable at the moment of default increased by an add-on of $5\\%$ points. I have seen some banks adopting overly theoretical approaches to set the discount factor based upon for example the capital asset pricing model. My practical advice would be to keep it more simple as follows: use the contract rate to start off with and perform a sensitivity analysis of the LGD with respect to the discount factor. In case the LGD would be highly sensitive to the discount factor an extra margin can be added based upon expert input for example. Note that the issue of setting the discount factor is the subject of\n",
    "ongoing debate between supervisors and banks. IFRS 9 suggests to use the effective interest rate for discounting.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Typically, any real-life LGD data set will contain negative LGDs and LGDs exceeding $100\\%$. An obvious question is where do these extreme values come from and how should they be treated? A negative LGD is the same as a recovery rate exceeding $100\\%$. There could be various reasons for this. One example is that the EAD was measured at the time of default and the claim on the borrower increased after that because of fines or fees and everything was recovered. In other words, the amount recovered was higher than the EAD hereby giving a recovery rate of bigger than $100\\%$, or a negative LGD. Another reason for a negative LGD could be a gain in collateral sales. Negative LGDs should be capped at zero. The EBA regulation says: where institutions observe that they realize profit on their observations of defaults, the realized LGD on these observations should equal zero for the purpose of calculation of the observed average LGD and the estimation of the long run average LGD. Vice versa LGDs exceeding $100\\%$ correspond to negative recovery rates. Also here there could be various reasons for this. The first one is that additional recovery costs were incurred whereas nothing was recovered. Alternatively, it could have been that additional drawings after default were considered as part of LGD hereby seriously increasing the costs. Also here it is recommended to cap LGDs exceeding $100\\%$ at $100\\%$ or put them in a separate segment. The EBA regulation says: where institutions observe extremely high values of realized LGDs much above $100\\%$, especially for exposures with small outstanding amounts at the moment of default, they should identify relevant risk drivers to differentiate these observations and adequately reflect\n",
    "these specific characteristics in the assignment to grades or pools. Where institutions use a continuous rating scale in the LGD estimation they may create a separate calibration segment for such exposures. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Remember we already mentioned that LGD represents economic loss. Hence, also\n",
    "indirect costs should be properly taken into account. Here you can see some quotes from regulatory documents to\n",
    "illustrate this. The definition of loss used in estimating LGD is economic loss. This must include material discount effects and material direct and indirect costs associated with collecting on the exposure. For the purpose of the calculation of the realized LGDs, institutions should take into account all material direct and indirect costs related to the recovery process. Examples of indirect costs are the costs of running the collection and workout department, the costs of outsourced services, an appropriate percentage of overhead etc Note that indirect costs should not be considered according to IFRS 9. The question now is how to take\n",
    "into account these indirect costs. Obviously, indirect costs are not tracked on a defaulter by defaulter basis so\n",
    "need to be calculated on an aggregated level. Most banks conduct a small accounting exercise to calculate the\n",
    "indirect cost rate. Here you can see an example of this. Suppose we have four years of data from 2015 to 2018. The\n",
    "second column represents the total exposure at default of files in workout measured at the end of the year. Note\n",
    "that because the workout period usually lasts longer than a year, most of these numbers include double counts. In other words, in the number 1500 measured in 2016 there are some observations which were also already included in the 1,000 measured in 2015. The third column represents the amount recovered in each year. There\n",
    "are no double counts here. Finally, the last column represents the aggregated internal workout cost per year. This\n",
    "includes the costs of the workout department, the salaries of the people working in it, the electricity, the computer hardware and software etc. We can now calculate two cost rates. The first one uses the exposure at default as the denominator. The assumption here is that higher workout costs are incurred for higher exposures at default. The cost rate can now be calculated in a time weighted or pooled way. The time weighted cost rate is just the average for all years of the workout cost divided by the exposure at default. For our example this becomes\n",
    "$1.8\\%$. The pooled cost rate divides the sum of all workout costs by the sum of all exposure values. In our case this becomes $1.91\\%$. A disadvantage when using this cost rate is that it has to be multiplied by the number of years the workout lasted. Another way of calculating cost rate is by using the amount recovered as the denominator. The assumption here is that higher workout costs are incurred for higher recoveries. Again the cost rate can be calculated in a time weighted or pooled way. The time weighted cost rate is the average for all years of the workout costs divided by the recovery amounts. For our example, this becomes $6.5\\%$. The pooled cost rate\n",
    "divides the sum of all workout costs by the sum of all recovered amounts. In our case, this becomes $6.49\\%$.\n",
    "The advantage of this approach is that it is independent of the length of the workout period because each amount was recovered during one year only. Hence this is simpler to implement. Here you can see both cost rates applied\n",
    "to the calculation of LGD. Let's first define the recovery rate as the net actualized cash flow NCF divided by\n",
    "the EAD. The NCF can then be calculated by discounting all the cash flows using a discount factor i. In the first option the cost rate is multiplied by the length of the workout period and the EAD as you can see. In the second\n",
    "option the cost rate can be directly used to correct the collected cash flows.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Let's now have a look at the variables that can be used to model LGD. Let's kick\n",
    "off with a quote from the EBA: Hence, as the LGD estimates are applied to non defaulted exposures, institutions should use the values of risk drivers from before the moment of default in the estimation of LGD. These risk drivers are typically collected at least one year before default. Four types of characteristics to be included in an LGD model are: obligor characteristics, macroeconomic factors, loan characteristics and country specific regulations. First of all obligor characteristics can be considered. Given a correlation often observed between default and loss rates it is advised to include a measure of creditworthiness in the LGD dataset. Examples are a PD, a credit rating, an application or behavioral score, a bureau score, trends in the credit worthiness, rating changes, delinquency history, etc. In case of retail obligors, you can also include social demographic variables such as marital status, gender, if allowed by the regulation, salary, time at address, time at job, etc. Also\n",
    "variables measuring the intensity of the bank relationship such as number of years client, number of products with a bank can be considered. In case of corporates you can include industry sector, sector indicators, size of the\n",
    "company, legal form of the company, age of the company, balance sheet information such as revenue, total assets, solvency, profitability, liquidity, accounting ratios, etc. Macroeconomic factors will obviously also have an impact on LGD. Here you can think of gross domestic product (GDP), which reflects economic growth, aggregated default rates, inflation, unemployment rate, and interest rate which obviously will have an impact on the discount factor. A next important set of characteristics for LGD modeling are loan or facility characteristics. Usually collateralized loans have a lower LGD than non collateralized loans so it is also important to include variables such as type of the collateral. Popular examples here are real estate, cash, inventories, guarantees, etc. It is highly advised to qualify the collateral as precisely as possible. So in case of real estate you can further categorize the collateral into for example flat, apartment, villa, detached or semi-detached house. It speaks for itself that also the value of the collateral needs to be properly taken into account. An important variable\n",
    "here is the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio which is the ratio of the value of the loan or outstanding exposure to the\n",
    "value of the underlying collateral asset. To calculate this the current market value of the collateral is determined. In case of real estate collateral, this can be computed as follows: the current house price index divided by the house price index at the start of the loan times the value of the collateral at the start of\n",
    "the loan. The haircut can then be applied to the obtained market value to represent any additional costs and the\n",
    "forced sale. Historical haircuts can be calculated by dividing the forced sales price by the computed market value.\n",
    "Obviously, the loan-to-value ratio will\n",
    "vary through time and needs to be\n",
    "tracked as such.\n",
    "The EAD itself can also be used as a\n",
    "predictor for LGD. In case of bonds, the\n",

    "Bonds can be qualified as senior secured,\n",

    "amount above the seniority of the bond\n",
    "divided by the total debt, or the debt\n",

    "divided by the total debt. Finally, also\n",

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> We have now finished the construction of our LGD dataset. Just as with PD, our LGD data set needs to be pre processed to take care of any inconsistencies.

There could also be outliers which need to be detected first using, for example, z-scores, histograms, box plots and then treated using, for example, truncation procedures.

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> A first approach towards LGD modeling is segmentation. This means that one or more credit business experts decides upon the segmentation criteria to use. Popular examples are debt type, seniority class such as senior versus subordinated, collateral types such as secured versus unsecured, loan purpose or business segment. Once these segmentation criteria have been defined, historical averages will be computed to estimate the LGD. Simple table lookup procedures can then be adopted to find the LGD for an exposure in a particular segment. Here, you can see an example of an expert based segmentation scheme. The segmentation criteria are collateral type such as real estate, cash, inventories and other, and the loan-to-value ratio which is categorized as high when it's bigger than $80\\%$, medium when it's between 50 and 80 percent, and low when it's smaller than $50\\%$. The cells then contain the average historically observed LGDs. Note that you can also easily add a standard deviation and confidence interval if desired. Although expert based segmentation schemes are very user-friendly and intuitive, you will typically observe a wide variability of loss rates per segment. Hence, to explain the LGD variability in a more optimal way statistical estimation techniques should be adopted. </p>\n",

    "senior unsecured or increases with $18\\%$ when the loan is junior subordinated. Additionally the LGD increases with the US default rate from the previous year with a speed of $2\\%$ per unit. You can see that this is a very transparent and easy-to-understand model. When using linear regression for LGD modelling various problems arise. First, by default the linear regression output is not bounded between 0 and 1. Just as with logistic regression this can be easily remedied by using a sigmoid transformation as illustrated. Another more complex problem is that the LGD does not follow a normal distribution but usually has a skewed or bimodal distribution. This is a problem\n",

To the right you can see the distributions for each of the six data sets discussed to the left. None of the distributions look normal or even symmetric. In fact, most of them are either single or double peaked. This presents some serious challenges for building good linear regression models.</p>\n",

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> To model a unimodal or bimodal LGD distribution, Moody's introduced the idea\n",
    "of fitting a Beta distribution on the LGD variable. Beta distributions are very flexible and versatile and can fit a whole range of different empirical distributions as you can see displayed at the bottom: U shaped, skewed right,\n",
    "bell-shaped and skewed left. If the LGD distribution is unimodal one beta distribution usually suffices. For a\n",
    "bimodal LGD distribution, two or more Beta distributions may need to be fitted in a mixture model. Here you can see the Beta distribution defined. It is bounded between 0 and 1. Just as a normal distribution has parameters mu and sigma a Beta distribution has parameters alpha and beta. Both parameters allow to model a wide variety of distributions. They can be estimated using a maximum likelihood procedure or by using the method of moments. The latter works as follows: the mean mu of a Beta distribution equals alpha divided by alpha plus beta. The standard deviation is then equal to the square root of the ratio of alpha times beta and alpha plus beta squared times 1\n",
    "plus alpha plus beta. From both these expressions, you can now back out alpha and beta using some straightforward\n",
    "mathematical operations. This will result into alpha equals mu squared times 1 minus mu divided by sigma squared minus mu and beta equals alpha times 1 divided by mu minus 1. Here you can see the method of moments for estimating alpha and beta illustrated. Suppose we have a data set with defaulted exposures, predictor variables such as collateral and LTV and the target LGD variable. You can then calculate the average of the LGD which is $44\\%$ in our case and its standard deviation which is $8\\%$ in our case. Both can then be plugged into the\n",
    "earlier formulas hereby yielding alpha equal to $16.94$ and beta equal to $21.56$. The beta distribution has now been parameterised. Suppose now that we fitted a Beta distribution on our LGD target variable. We can then use this beta distribution to transform or LGD variable to a new variable which more closely follows a normal distribution. This new variable can then be used as a target in an ordinary least-squares regression. This idea was first introduced by Moody's in its LossCalc tool. It works as follows. We start from the cumulative Beta\n",
    "distribution displayed on the left and the cumulative standard normal distribution displayed on the right. Remember, a standard normal distribution has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. We put our LGD value into the cumulative beta distribution. We then put the value obtained into the inverse cumulative standard normal distribution. This will then give us the transformed LGD value which we can use as target in our linear regression. As already mentioned this transformed LGD variable will now be more closely normally distributed and as such may give us a better performing linear regression model. Here, you can see a step by step outline of the method discussed. We start by estimating the alpha and beta parameters of the Beta distribution using the method of moments. This will give us the Beta distribution together with its cumulative variant. The original LGDs can then be transformed using this cumulative Beta distribution. The numbers obtained are then put into the inverse\n",
    "cumulative standard normal distribution which will give us the values to be used in a linear regression. Once the linear regression has been estimated it can be used for prediction. To get the original LGD predictions based on a regression you need to perform all steps backwards. In other words, the predictions of the linear regression need to be put into the cumulative standard normal distribution first followed by the inverse cumulative Beta distribution. Note that this mapping procedure is very easy to implement in analytical software and requires only a few lines of code. A problem with using the beta distribution is that it cannot cope with LGD values equal to 0 or 1. As already mentioned these cases typically occur in real-life LGD data sets. A first option is to use a scaling factor epsilon and make sure the LGD ranges between 0.01 and 0.99 for example. An alternative is to use a zero one inflated Beta regression. The idea here is to decompose the LGD model into three parts. Two probabilities $\\pi_0$ and $\\pi_1$ representing the probability that LGD equals 0 or 1 respectively and a beta distribution for the intermediate values. Both probabilities $\\pi_0$ and $\\pi_1$ can then be regressed on a set of predictor variables using logistic regression. The mean and standard deviation of the Beta distribution can also be regressed on a set of predictor variables. The regression parameters can then be determined using maximum likelihood optimization. The model can also include interaction and nonlinear effects using splines for example. The key advantage is that different variables can pop up as significant in the various models hereby giving maximum flexibility and also model performance. A disadvantage however is that four models are obtained which increases the complexity of the approach. This model is more extensively discussed by Swearingen, Castro and Bursac and Tong, Mues and Thomas in the references cited.</p>\n",

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'> Another way to model LGD is by mapping it into a classification problem and\n",
    "build a logistic regression model. This is the approach followed by Van Berkel and Siddiqi in the reference cited.\n",

Every category has a score assigned to it. The bad rating represents the LGD. A key advantage of this method is that it results into a very user-friendly easy to understand LGD scorecard.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "expert based input or by building a regression tree. Another commonly used approach is to build two models: a\n",
    "classification model predicting cures and a regression model predicting the LGD given that an account has not cured. In other words, the LGD is calculated as follows: the probability of cure times a fixed handling cost plus one minus the probability of cure multiplied by the LGD of the workout procedure. The probability of cure can then be obtained using a classification model such as a logistic regression or a decision tree for example. The LGD workout, sometimes also referred to as loss given loss, can then be the result of a regression model such as a regression tree or linear regression. Once this model has been estimated it can also easily be used to do stress\n",
    "testing. One simple stress scenario could correspond to stressing the cure rates for example. Here you can see another example of a two-stage model for mortgages as it was developed by Leow and Mues in the reference cited. Once an obligor has gone into default, 180 consecutive days of missed payments in our case, the first model will be a classification model estimating the probability of repossessing the collateral. In case of repossession, a second model is estimated to determine the price at which the collateral can be sold. Both models can then be combined to estimate the final loss.</p>\n",
